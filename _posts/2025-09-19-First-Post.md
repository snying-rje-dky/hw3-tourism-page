Each autumn, silver fog drapes the lofty hills of Berribula, and the mystical berries awaken. Said to draw their sweetness from the mist itself, they glow in hues of magma, gold, and twilight purple. Berries so rare they vanish the moment the season ends!

Local Berribulans speak of their powers: witches whisper of their mystical properties, musicians swear they stir dreams into melodies, and chefs craft glowing wines and velvety jams. Many travelers describe the taste as sunlight wrapped in cool morning air, others describe it as a frosty breeze intertwined with the very cosmos itself. 

Part harvest, part legend, the Misty Berry Season is one of Berribulaâ€™s countless enchanting experiences for all to enjoy.
